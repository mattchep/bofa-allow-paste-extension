# Bank of America Allow Pasting Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows you to PASTE on bankofamerica.com. I made it because the extension "Don't Fuck With Paste" didn't work and I want to be able to PASTE a dollar amount when transferring between accounts like a normal human.

The field gets highlighted yellow so you know it's working.

Install the unpacked extension and enjoy: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-form-outside-the-chrome-web-store
